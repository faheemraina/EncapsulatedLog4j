# CommonLogging

**encapsulated-logger** provides the API for writing log messages during the execution of a program to a central place. This common library is essentially a Wrapper on top of [Apache Log4j2 ](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html) 
This logging allows you to report and persist error and warning messages as well as info messages (e.g., runtime statistics) so that the messages can later be retrieved and analyzed.
